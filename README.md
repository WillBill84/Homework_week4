# homework_week4 - Code Quiz
--------------------------------------------------

## Description


This week our homework assignment was to build a multiple choice coding quiz app. We were given a brief and an example of what the app was to look and function like and we were then tasked to write the HTML, CSS and Javascript to produce a completed quiz game. 

I used questions from W3schools.com to populate my quiz, mainly sticking to ones that had 4 multiple choice answers. 

## Functionality

The quiz features a front page with some text explaining how the game works, a start button and an option to view previous scores. 

The quiz questions are based around basic javascript knowledge and are multiple choice. There is a timer element to the game that penalises you 10 seconds on a wrong answer. I have made it so each correct answer gives one 1 point and at the end of the game adds you points up with the remaining time to give you your total score, if your time runs out the game ends.

when presented with the game over screen you are given your total score and an input to enter your initials to log your scores. You can view player scores at any time and clear previous scores empty the logs. 


## Improvements

some things that I might improved in the future are: 

Using more dynamically updated html elements with javascript. I came to the realisation towards the end of the build that i could have reduced the amount of html and css used by setting up one main "page" with a core set of html elements and used javascript more to update those elements throughout the quiz rather than use a "show/hide" technique to display each section of the quiz which kind of bloats out the size of the overall app. It was just a bit more intuitive for me to visualise each section of the quiz and make it work that way until i had to create the scores and dynamically update the page then penny dropped but was out of time by this stage.. 


also maybe adding a top 3 or a top 5 High scores that checks your quiz scores each time with the current score list. If your score is greater than any of the current logged/rendered scores then show otherwise don't give an option to input initials and display message instead.



some better styling or a theme. I did a pretty generic kind of bootstrap looking layout just to get things working but it could become a more interesting style or theme and make a more fun "game-show" type environment to add some extra levels of fun..?.
